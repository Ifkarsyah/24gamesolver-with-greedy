# 24 Game Solver with Greedy Algorithm

The 24 Game is an arithmetical card game in which the objective is to find a way to manipulate four integers so that the end result is 24. For example, for the card with the numbers 4, 7, 8, 8, a possible solution is (7-(8/8) x 4)=24 . [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/24_Game)
